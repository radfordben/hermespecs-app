## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### API Configuration

Configure in `VisionAPIConfig.swift`:

```swift
struct VisionAPIConfig {
    // Alibaba Cloud API Key
    static let apiKey = "sk-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"

    // API Base URL (usually doesn't need modification)
    static let baseURL = "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com"
}
```

### System Prompts

Customize AI response style in `OmniRealtimeService.swift`:

```swift
"instructions": "You are a RayBan Meta smart glasses AI assistant. Keep answers concise and conversational..."
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Q1: Glasses won't connect?

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure glasses are successfully paired in Meta View App
2. Check if Bluetooth is enabled
3. Restart TurboMeta App
4. Restart glasses (place in charging case)
5. Ensure Meta DAT SDK Preview Mode is enabled in Meta View App

### Q2: AI not responding or responding slowly?

**Solutions**:
1. Check if internet connection is stable
2. Verify API Key is correctly configured
3. Check if Alibaba Cloud API quota is sufficient
4. Review console logs for errors

### Q3: Nutrition analysis results inaccurate?

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure food photos are clear
2. Take photos in good lighting
3. Show food completely in frame
4. AI analysis is for reference only, not a substitute for professional nutritionists

### Q4: Xcode build fails or cannot run on device?

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your iPhone is registered as a development device in Xcode
2. Verify your signing configuration in Xcode → Signing & Capabilities
3. Change the Bundle Identifier in Xcode project settings to avoid conflicts
4. Ensure you are signed in with a valid Apple ID in Xcode → Settings → Accounts

### Q5: Voice recognition inaccurate?

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure environment is relatively quiet
2. Speak clearly at moderate speed
3. Don't obstruct the microphone
4. Currently optimized for Chinese, other languages may be less accurate

## 🔗 OpenClaw Integration

TurboMeta supports connecting to [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) — an open-source personal AI assistant. Through OpenClaw, you can snap photos with your glasses and have AI analyze them, or use voice-to-text to chat with AI.

### Features

- 📷 **Photo Capture**: One-tap to capture glasses view and send to OpenClaw AI
- 🎙️ **Voice Transcription**: Real-time speech-to-text via Alibaba Fun-ASR, auto-sent to AI
- ⌨️ **Text Chat**: Type messages directly to AI
- 🔄 **Auto-connect**: Saved configuration auto-connects on launch

> ⚠️ Due to Meta DAT SDK limitations, the glasses camera cannot be accessed in the background. Use the photo capture feature while the app is in the foreground.

### Setup

#### 1. Install and Start OpenClaw

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
openclaw gateway install
```

#### 2. Configure Gateway for LAN Access

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "lan",
    "nodes": {
      "allowCommands": ["camera.snap", "camera.clip", "camera.list", "device.status", "device.info"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart: `openclaw gateway restart`

#### 3. Connect from App

1. Open TurboMeta → Settings → OpenClaw
2. Enter Gateway address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) and port (`18789`)
3. Enter Gateway Token (found in the OpenClaw Dashboard URL)
4. Tap Connect

First connection requires device pairing approval:

```bash
openclaw devices list    # View pending devices
openclaw devices approve # Approve pairing
```

#### 4. Remote Access (Optional)

For accessing Gateway outside your LAN, use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/):

1. Install Tailscale on both the Gateway machine and your phone
2. Log in with the same Tailscale account on both devices
3. In the app, use the Tailscale-assigned IP (e.g., `100.x.x.x:18789`)

Tailscale creates an encrypted peer-to-peer tunnel — no public ports needed.
